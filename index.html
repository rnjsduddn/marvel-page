      <p>Former Air Force pilot and intelligence agent Carol Danvers pursued her dream of space exploration as a NASA employee, but her life forever changed when she was accidentally transformed into a human-Kree hybrid with extraordinary powers.</p>
      <p>Now, Carol is the latest warrior to embrace the mantle of Captain Marvel, and she has taken her place as one of the world’s mightiest heroes.</p>
      <h2>Higher, Further, Faster, More</h2>
      <p>As a NASA security officer, Carol investigated numerous attempts made by the Kree and Skrulls to infiltrate Kennedy Space Center and disrupt America’s space program. During a battle between the heroic Mar-Vell and his rival, Yon-Rogg, Carol was exposed to the Psyche-Magnitron, a Kree device that could make imagination into reality. Carol subconsciously envied Mar-Vell’s powers, and the machine responded to those desires by rewriting her DNA to make her a human/Kree hybrid with abilities similar to his.</p>

      <p>Natalia Alianovna Romanoff was born on December 3,[8] 1984[1] in Stalingrad, Russia. As an infant, she was deemed by the Red Room to possess genetic potential, and was purchased from her birth family. However, Romanoff's mother was not in agreement and proceeded to search for her, until General Dreykov had her killed to prevent the Red Room Program's existence from being revealed.</p>
      <h2>Trained by the Best</h2>
      <p>I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job. This family. And I was better because of it. And even though they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.</p>

      <p>Thanos was one of the last sons of A'Lars, progenitor of the second colony of Eternals on Titan, and Sui-San, the last survivor of the original settlement of Eternals in this moon. He was born with purple, hide-like skin and a massive body due to his Deviant Syndrome. The very first time his mother laid her eyes on the baby, she was driven mad and tried to kill him.</p>
      <h2>For Death’s Sake</h2>
      <p>Am I not Thanos! Did I not butcher the woman who gave me birth, who force-fed me into this hell called life?! Is not the wake of my passing crimson with the blood of my enemies and allies alike?! Death is with me every second of the day! My every moment is spent in either dealing out death or worshiping it! So tell me, who under the stars is better suited than I to be Death's consort?</p>
